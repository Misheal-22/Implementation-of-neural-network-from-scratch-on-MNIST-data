# Implementation-of-neural-network-from-scratch-on-MNIST-data
Implemented a neural network from scratch without using tensorflow/pytorch just numpy and linear algebra. <br>
At first I worked with: Input → Hidden Layer (10 units) → Output (10 classes) and got accuracy of just 84%. <br>
Then i worked more on my project and trained it with better parameters, introduced one more weight and bias as w3 and b3 and updated it to 91.6%: <br>
Input → Hidden Layer 1 (128 units) → Hidden Layer 2 (64 units) → Output.
